# Project Name

The assignment for week 4 was to build a chatbot in JavaScript. Me and Jenny created a BOT SHOP where the user is able to order a bike in a specific model and color.

## The problem

We started off by doing a mockup which made it easier for us to write the code in JavaScript. We got inspired by other projects to get a better understanding for the functions and variables. If we would have more time we would probably add more alternatives for the user to choose from.
